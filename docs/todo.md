X build hex map
X genome class
X creature class
X unit tests for map, genome and creature
X implement hunt, eat, flee, and mate
X merge genomes

X achieve self-sustaining life
/ wolf dens: when wolf population gets low, spawn a cross of the two with the most offspring
  fox dens too
  double axons (and, or, multiply, divide, accumulate)
  calls and signals
  inverse relationship between fertility and starting energy of offspring (r vs k strategy)
X encode genome into one long string
/ save and load the world as a collection of map nodes and their occupants
X optimization: stop scanning after one of each food type is found
  creatures should have a unique ID
