X build hex map
X genome class
X creature class
X unit tests for map, genome and creature
X implement hunt, eat, flee, and mate
X merge genomes
X implement main loop
X achieve self-sustaining life
X wolf dens: when wolf population gets low, spawn a cross of the two with the most offspring
  fox dens too
X double axons (and, or, multiply, divide, accumulate)
  calls and signals
  inverse relationship between fertility and starting energy of offspring (r vs k strategy)
X encode genome into one long string
X save and load the world as a collection of map nodes and their occupants
X optimization: stop scanning after one of each food type is found
X creatures should have a unique ID
X make 'sprint' into an action (double speed for 'stamina' moves)
X avoid making duplicates when combining genomes
  allow creatures a fight-or-flight choice on processStimulus('self_attacked')
  roll speed vs speed to flee or deadliness vs deadliness to fight

  thank kat for being sweet to bear lately :) <3
