can we get emergent evolution of multiple species?

The minimal neural nets of these little babies use a unique archeticture optimized for quick execution, discrete quantized actions, and human readability/programability. The game is fairly simple and the 'brains' are built to match. Each has four sets of neurons: sense, memory, relay and action, which fire in that order. The 'thought process' is repeated for each creature or resource visible within the creature's 'sight cone'.
